# 04 Launch Config

## Play by Play
1. Discuss complication when using some frameworks like Streamlit, FastAPI, Chainlit, or others
   1. These frameworks call *your* code and so you cannot just run your code directly
   2. You have to run them through these modules
2. Run example Streamlit app with `streamlit run src/04_launch_config.py`
3. Demonstrate app and bug
4. Try to debug app, explain error
5. Create `launch.json`
6. Run app with launch config
7. Step through to find bug and fix it


## Summary
- Launch config for more complex script invocations (modules, arguments)

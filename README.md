# Freezing Time and X-Ray Vision: Debugging Superpowers in Python

Wondering why your code is not doing what it should be doing? Getting an error that you don’t understand? Ever wish you could hit pause on your code and see exactly what’s going on behind the scenes? In this hands-on, one-hour workshop, we’ll unlock your debugging superpowers in Python using Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Discover how to “freeze time” to inspect variables, set breakpoints, step through your code, and fix errors with confidence. We’ll dive into both basic and advanced debugging techniques with simple Python examples, giving you an x-ray vision of your programs in action.

Whether you’re new to debugging or want to sharpen your skills, this session will equip you to write and troubleshoot Python code more efficiently than ever before. All experience levels are welcome—bring your curiosity and get ready to level up your problem-solving toolkit!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You should have the following installed:

- [Python >=3.8](https://www.python.org/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Python and Jupyter Notebook extension

### Setup

- [Open this directory in VS Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3PMR8voOo0).
- Create a Python Virtual Environment:
  - Hit `⌘+⇧+p` on a Mac or `Ctrl+Shift+p` on Windows to bring up the command palette at the top
  - Type `Python create env` and select `Python: Create Environment...`
  - Create a new `venv` and install dependencies from the `requirements.txt`

### Usage

- `src` contains all code examples for the workshop.
- `notes` contains the speaker notes fo reach example.
- `ppt` contains the introductory slide deck

Follow along during the session using the examples in `src`. You can find versions of the examples, where the bugs have been fixed in `src/solutions` (look for the comment starting with `FIXME` for an explanation).

Happy debugging!
